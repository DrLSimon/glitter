<h3>Part 1: the <tt>git</tt> revision control system</h3>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>
	The base code of glitter is provided as a <tt>git</tt> repository. <tt>git</tt>
	is the most widespread distributed version control system in use today—it is a good
	idea to familiarize yourself with this system if you've never used it before.
        As the semester progresses, we will push out a number of additions to
        the glitter framework. You can simply <tt>merge</tt> our new revisions
        into your repository to benefit from these improvements.

Recommended learning resources for git are:
<a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">try git</a>,
<a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">git-the simple guide</a>,
the <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/index.html">git immersion tutorial</a>, and
the extensive free <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> ebook.
The remainder of this section describes the steps needed to clone and compile the glitter base code.

	<h3>Cloning using the command line</h3>
	<p>
		The source code of glitter is available on <a
		href="https://github.com/DrLsimon/glitter">github</a>.
		To check out a copy of the source code, enter
	</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ git clone --depth=1 --single-branch \
  https://github.com/DrLSimon/glitter
</pre>
  <p>
  on the terminal. The two flags (<tt>--depth=1</tt> and
  <tt>--single-branch</tt>) are only useful to save up disk space.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
	<h3>Updating the codebase</h3>
  <p>
  We'll likely publish extensions and bug-fixes to this
  repository as the semester progresses. To get them, 
  navigate into the <tt>glitter</tt> directory and run the command
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ git pull</pre>
  If there were any concurrent modifications to the same file,
  <tt>git</tt> may ask you to resolve merge conflicts. We refer you to
  the learning resources for information about resolving conflicts in
  general.

<div class="row col-md-12">
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Note</b>: Since your
        repository will contain homework solutions it is (obviously) not OK to
        post it online (in particular, don't fork the <tt>glitter</tt> project on
        github or elsewhere). Private forks (i.e. without public access) are
        allowed, however.

<h3>Part 2: Setting up a C++ compiler and building the base code</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h3>Configuring on Linux / Mac OS X terminal</h3>
		<p>
		Begin by installing the
		<a href="http://www.cmake.org/download/">CMake</a> build system on your
		system. On Mac OS X, you will also need to install a reasonably
		up-to-date version of XCode along with the command line tools.
		On Linux, any reasonably recent version of GCC or Clang will work.
		Navigate to the glitter folder, create a build directory and start <tt>cmake</tt>, like so:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ cd path-to-glitter
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</pre>

		<h3>Building on Linux / Mac OS X terminal</h3>
		After the Makefiles are generated, simply run
		<tt>make</tt> to compile all dependencies and glitter itself.
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ make -j 4</pre>
		This can take quite a while; the above command compiles with four
		processors at the same time. Note that you will probably see many
		warning messages while the dependencies are compiled—you can ignore
		them.
  </div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Configuring and building on QtCreator</h3>
    Start by opening the <tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> file with QtCreator. Then a 
    configuration menu will be presented.

    <div class="thumbnail">
      <a class="fancybox" href="images/qtcreator-config.jpg"><img src="images/qtcreator-config.jpg"/></a>
      <div class="caption">
        Simply press <tt>Configure Project</tt> button.
      </div>
    </div>
    
    Once the project is configured, you can build / run / debug the executables within
    QtCreator.

<h3>Part 3: A high-level overview</h3>
The glitter repository consists of the base code files (left table)
and several dependency libraries (right table) that are briefly explained below.
